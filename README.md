**Introduction**
IBM, a global technology and consulting company, boasts a diverse and skilled workforce, encompassing professionals in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. With a commitment to innovation and inclusivity, IBM values its employees' expertise in driving advancements in technology solutions. The workforce reflects a dynamic blend of experienced professionals and emerging talent, fostering a collaborative environment to address contemporary challenges in the ever-evolving tech landscape. This project intends to identify factors behind employee attrition in the organisation.

**Business problem**
Employee attrition analysis is a pressing business problem involving assessing factors influencing workforce turnover. Organizations seek to understand the reasons behind staff departures to optimize retention strategies. They are analyzing historical data, evaluating job satisfaction, and identifying patterns that aid in predicting attrition risks. Addressing this challenge enhances organizational stability, employee morale, and overall productivity, shaping a proactive approach towards talent management and fostering a resilient workforce. This analysis aims to identify factors behind employee attrition in the organization.

**Analysis**
The analysis has been conducted on 1470 records provided by IBM. Employees with high performance are receiving around a 10 per cent hike though the company can provide more than a 20 percent hike based on performance. Employees are between 0 and 5 years of experience in research and development and sales are leaving the company. Employees are getting more than average work-life balance. Employees are not concerned about overtime in the work. Most of the employees are leaving the company due to the low percentage of salary hikes.  

**Recommendation**
IBM needs to increase the percentage of salary hikes to retain its employee base. Also more recognition and reward in research and development, sales and lab will make employees satisfied.
